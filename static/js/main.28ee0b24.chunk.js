It\u2019s about the encroachment of civilization on the Old West in the United States, and how people flocked to the pristine beauty of the land and basically trashed it.'},{title:"Numb   --Linkin Park",image:"images/numb.jpg",details:"The song has that natural feel of being kicked out from everywhere inspite of trying to be yourself. This song just reflects the fact that people follow trends and the crowd mentality. They have shut the doors of their mind and cannot think outside the box yet everyone wants you to be like them. The line where Chester says someone is trying to smother him, it is rather true. People are trying to bury the originality in themselves and follow what others are doing. Thus in a way trying to stop you from breathing and slowly you are getting succumbed towards death."},{title:"You Know My Name   --Chris Cornell",image:"images/chriss cornell.jpg",details:'"You Know My Name" is the theme song of the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale. It\'s "Chance" or the thrill of risk and cheating death. The film itself revolves around Bond being drawn to risk, even dying and being resuscitated at one point. He kills bad guys reflexively. But those victories come with just as many losses.'},{title:"Nobody Can Save Me   --Linkin Park",image:"images/nobody can save me.jpg",details:"Chester is explaining how nobody can save him. Cause only he can save him. And he's been looking for the answers to his problems but the answers were within him. And even though he's been forgiven and told it will be alright. The problem lies within his mind and his struggles with addiction and overcoming his past. So he's basically saying there are metaphorical demons in his head that are trying to make him relapse and they're reminding him of his past which is causing him great distress."},{title:"A Place For My Head   --Linkin Park",image:"images/hybrid theory.jpg",details:"It's about someone who tries to take things away from you. They do things for you and always expect something in return. The chorus is stating that the person doesn't understand what you're trying to tell them when you try to explain things to them. So he wants a safe place where no one is expecting anything from him."},{title:"Start Again   --One Republic",image:"images/start again.jpg",details:"The song is about them living in a post apocalyptic world where there are no more vegetation and plants and constant nuclear wars.

Telling us that if we continue living the way we're living now, we're gonna beg to be able to start again."},{title:"Waiting For The End   --Linkin Park",image:"images/waiting for the end.jpg",details:"This song depicts about the phase of one's life where he/she has to take a decision to end something and move on. Change is essential as nothing is eternal and they cannot hold on to that forever but change is painful too. In the song it is clearly mentioned the reason of change being painful because hardest part of ending something is that he/she has to start all over again because at the end, the person is not ready and has already lost most of his/her strength."},{title:"Lost In The Echo   --Linkin Park",image:"images/lost in the echo.jpg",details:"This song is about becoming trapped in our past. We all go through things that are painful to experience, sometimes, it is so painful, we never let it go. In the video, everything is overgrown, as if it were left uncared for. This represents the mind of one who dwells on the past- They have given up caring about their well being, and living in the now... they only focus on the pain. Lost in the echo of whatever event changed their life so dramatically. In the video, a man (Gino the Ghost) brings these people photographs. The other people involved in the event... people forgotten about, since all they remember is the pain. Upon seeing these photos, they are forced to remember, and reflect upon the person. If someone loves you, they would want you to move on, and keep living... not to give in to the pain, and become lost in your memories. When they scream at each other, it is the original person confronting the realisation that they want better for you... and so, the person shatters, finally freed from the prison of their own mind. The person from the original photo stays behind, as a reminder of who they were, and the person they were, is far more important than remembering the pain or despair of losing someone. When the person leaves a photo of themself behind after shattering, it is like a new memory being born. One of resolution, and peace with our past."},{title:"I Was Never There   --Weeknd",image:"images/i was never there.jpg",details:"This song depicts about the weak relationship that how the bond becomes too weak that he starts geeling nothing and can make even a grown man wanna cry.

He wants to take a break and think about what he had done in his life and instead of suppressing emotions, he wants to let them out. He is regretting that he should have listened to his heart than his brain. He realized the point of his fall but he also said answers will find us in the end due to his doubts. Also, realization is the new beginning in his life."},{title:"Twenty Eight   --Weeknd",image:"images/house of balloons.jpg",details:'Twenty Eight is all about the Weeknd singing about his frustration about the fact that he is a public image now and how he won\'t be able to live his life the way he used to anymore. In this song weeknd describes about the stripper that she brags about being with the Weeknd due to his success of mixtape and now everybody  knows about him and that has made things harder for him as people now know "where I (he) sleep (sleeps)".'},{title:"Faith   --Weeknd",image:"images/after hours.jpg",details:'The Weeknd says "Faith" is the only After Hours track that doesn\'t take place in the present, but rather recalls a troubling time back in 2013-14. "It\u2019s about the darkest time of my entire life, a time when I was getting really, really tossed up and going through a lot of personal stuff," he told Variety. "This is around 2013-14: I got arrested in Vegas, it was a real rockstar era, which I wasn\u2019t really proud of, and at the end of [the song] you hear sirens. That\u2019s me in the back of the cop car, that moment. "He continued: "I always wanted to make that song but I never did, and this album felt like the perfect time, because of the setting of Las Vegas, and [the character needing] a kind of escape after a heartbreak or whatever, \'I\'m gonna go to Vegas and drown all my sorrows,\' and by the time you get to the end of the album you realize it\u2019s more of a redemption."'},{title:"Papercut   --Linkin Park",image:"images/papercut.jpg",details:'The first verse explains that the person in question can feel that something isn\'t right but they don\'t know what it is and the metaphor for the thing that isn\'t right with is expressed as "the face inside". The "face inside" that Mike is talking about is the paranoia and the monsters inside your head. They could symbolise insecurities, depression, anxiety, whatever you can relate to. The lyric "right beneath my skin" means that "the face inside" is a part of you that criticises everything you and makes you paranoid of every mistake, every move you make, etc. The chorus is quite easy to understand, the whirlwind is the cacophony of thoughts that surges through one\'s mind when they are confused to a point that paranoia is all that they think of and they watch their every step and move, afraid of what "the face inside" will think - that is, what their critical side will think. When the sun goes down youre being left behind in the darkness thats already too much to bear, and you realize the darkness inside you now matches the darkness outside of you.'},{title:"The Town   --Weeknd",image:"images/the town.jpg",details:"Some of the most exceptional high notes of weeknd can be found in this song.

In this song the weeknd is trying to convice a girl to take ecstasy for the first time as she dont know what to expect. He is assuring and confort her to spend the night with her by reassuring what he is doing is good."},{title:"Bohemian Rhapsody   --Queen",image:"images/bohemian rhapsody about.jpg",details:"The title of the song is Bohemian Rhapsody . So, a rhapsody is a type of song that has an irregular form, with lots of improvisation,a sort of free structure, and it's often very emotional in character. So, this is a bohemian rhapsody. Bohemian is a word which describes a person who\u2019s sort of unconventional, who lives a lifestyle that's a bit abnormal, almost in an artistic way.\nThere are several interpretations of this song and Freddie Mercury never revealed its true meaning and left it to listerners themselves. This song is 6 minutes long and have no chorus. The art and style of this very similar to Shakespeare play"},{title:"Jesus Of Suburbia   --Green Day",image:"images/jesus_sof_suburbia_about.jpg",details:"The song tells the tale of suburban Jesus, a working class teen without faith or direction. In telling his story, important issues are encountered with a focus on the working class teen.  The shallow and hypocritical nature of mainstream media is also touched upon. The music flows between the five parts like a rock opera, and it works with the lyrics to give us a deeper sense of the challenges Jesus faces. It's capturing a feeling that so many of us have felt; feeling trapped in the town you grew up in, with the pressures of achieving some future prescribed to you by people who don't really care.\n\nThis song is teenager's national anthem as it captures the emotions about how they feel about society and their hypocrisy.
