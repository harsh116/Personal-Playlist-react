This song just reflects the fact that people follow trends and the crowd mentality. They have shut the doors of their mind and cannot think outside the box yet everyone wants you to be like them. The line where Chester says someone is trying to smother him, it is rather true. People are trying to bury the originality in themselves and follow what others are doing.

The problem lies within his mind and his struggles with addiction and overcoming his past. So he's basically saying there are metaphorical demons in his head that are trying to make him relapse and they're reminding him of his past which is causing him great distress."},{title:"A Place For My Head   --Linkin Park",image:"images/hybrid theory.jpg",details:"It's about someone who tries to take things away from you.

Change is essential as nothing is eternal and they cannot hold on to that forever but change is painful too.

We all go through things that are painful to experience, sometimes, it is so painful, we never let it go. In the video, everything is overgrown, as if it were left uncared for. This represents the mind of one who dwells on the past- They have given up caring about their well being, and living in the now... they only focus on the pain. Lost in the echo of whatever event changed their life so dramatically. In the video, a man (Gino the Ghost) brings these people photographs. The other people involved in the event... people forgotten about, since all they remember is the pain. Upon seeing these photos, they are forced to remember, and reflect upon the person. If someone loves you, they would want you to move on, and keep living... not to give in to the pain, and become lost in your memories. When they scream at each other, it is the original person confronting the realisation that they want better for you... and so, the person shatters, finally freed from the prison of their own mind. The person from the original photo stays behind, as a reminder of who they were, and the person they were, is far more important than remembering the pain or despair of losing someone. When the person leaves a photo of themself behind after shattering, it is like a new memory being born. One of resolution, and peace with our past."},{title:"I Was Never There   --Weeknd",image:"images/i was never there.jpg",details:"This song depicts about the weak relationship that how the bond becomes too weak that he starts geeling nothing and can make even a grown man wanna cry.

"It\u2019s about the darkest time of my entire life, a time when I was getting really, really tossed up and going through a lot of personal stuff," he told Variety. "This is around 2013-14: I got arrested in Vegas, it was a real rockstar era, which I wasn\u2019t really proud of, and at the end of [the song] you hear sirens. That\u2019s me in the back of the cop car, that moment. "He continued: "I always wanted to make that song but I never did, and this album felt like the perfect time, because of the setting of Las Vegas, and [the character needing] a kind of escape after a heartbreak or whatever, \'I\'m gonna go to Vegas and drown all my sorrows,\' and by the time you get to the end of the album you realize it\u2019s more of a redemption."'},{title:"Papercut   --Linkin Park",image:"images/papercut.jpg",details:'The first verse explains that the person in question can feel that something isn\'t right but they don\'t know what it is and the metaphor for the thing that isn\'t right with is expressed as "the face inside". The "face inside" that Mike is talking about is the paranoia and the monsters inside your head. They could symbolise insecurities, depression, anxiety, whatever you can relate to. The lyric "right beneath my skin" means that "the face inside" is a part of you that criticises everything you and makes you paranoid of every mistake, every move you make, etc. The chorus is quite easy to understand, the whirlwind is the cacophony of thoughts that surges through one\'s mind when they are confused to a point that paranoia is all that they think of and they watch their every step and move, afraid of what "the face inside" will think - that is, what their critical side will think. When the sun goes down youre being left behind in the darkness thats already too much to bear, and you realize the darkness inside you now matches the darkness outside of you.'},{title:"The Town   --Weeknd",image:"images/the town.jpg",details:"Some of the most exceptional high notes of weeknd can be found in this song.

feels so priceless to me\nThat you're always free\nThat you'll take me in\nNow I'm everything, your everything\nI bet you'll take me in\nI know you'll take me in now\nThe same place I left you in (we)\nI bet you'll take me in\nI know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in\nThe same place I left you in\n\n[Breakdown]\nWe\nWho?\nOooh...\nOooooooh...\nNo ho...\nLet her know...\n\n[Hook]\nYou did many things\nThat I liked, that I liked\nAnd you like diamond rings\nI can provide, I can provide for you\nYou made me feel so good\nBefore I left\nOn the road\nAnd you deserve your name\nOn a crown, on a throne\n\n"},{title:"High For This  --Weeknd",lyrics:"[Verse 1]\nYou don't know what's in store\nBut you know what you're here for\nClose your eyes, lay yourself beside me (Ooh)\nHold
