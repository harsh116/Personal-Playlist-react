		title: 'Numb   --Linkin Park',
		image: 'images/numb.jpg',
		details: 'The song has that natural feel of being kicked out from everywhere inspite of trying to be yourself. This song just reflects the fact that people follow trends and the crowd mentality. They have shut the doors of their mind and cannot think outside the box yet everyone wants you to be like them. The line where Chester says someone is trying to smother him, it is rather true. People are trying to bury the originality in themselves and follow what others are doing. Thus in a way trying to stop you from breathing and slowly you are getting succumbed towards death.',

		title: 'Nobody Can Save Me   --Linkin Park',
		image: 'images/nobody can save me.jpg',
		details: 'Chester is explaining how nobody can save him. Cause only he can save him. And he\'s been looking for the answers to his problems but the answers were within him. And even though he\'s been forgiven and told it will be alright. The problem lies within his mind and his struggles with addiction and overcoming his past. So he\'s basically saying there are metaphorical demons in his head that are trying to make him relapse and they\'re reminding him of his past which is causing him great distress.',

		image: 'images/hybrid theory.jpg',
		details: 'It\'s about someone who tries to take things away from you. They do things for you and always expect something in return. The chorus is stating that the person doesn\'t understand what you\'re trying to tell them when you try to explain things to them. So he wants a safe place where no one is expecting anything from him.',

		title: 'Lost In The Echo   --Linkin Park',
		image: 'images/lost in the echo.jpg' ,
		details: 'This song is about becoming trapped in our past. We all go through things that are painful to experience, sometimes, it is so painful, we never let it go. In the video, everything is overgrown, as if it were left uncared for. This represents the mind of one who dwells on the past- They have given up caring about their well being, and living in the now... they only focus on the pain. Lost in the echo of whatever event changed their life so dramatically. In the video, a man (Gino the Ghost) brings these people photographs. The other people involved in the event... people forgotten about, since all they remember is the pain. Upon seeing these photos, they are forced to remember, and reflect upon the person. If someone loves you, they would want you to move on, and keep living... not to give in to the pain, and become lost in your memories. When they scream at each other, it is the original person confronting the realisation that they want better for you... and so, the person shatters, finally freed from the prison of their own mind. The person from the original photo stays behind, as a reminder of who they were, and the person they were, is far more important than remembering the pain or despair of losing someone. When the person leaves a photo of themself behind after shattering, it is like a new memory being born. One of resolution, and peace with our past.' ,

		image: 'images/what we don\'t know.jpg',
		details: 'This song depicts the phase when someone is tired of just continuing on with his life. He wants to take a break and think about what he had done in his life and instead of suppressing emotions, he wants to let them out. He is regretting that he should have listened to his heart than his brain. He realized the point of his fall but he also said answers will find us in the end due to his doubts. Also, realization is the new beginning in his life.',

		title: 'Faith   --Weeknd',
		image: 'images/after hours.jpg',
		details: 'The Weeknd says "Faith" is the only After Hours track that doesn\'t take place in the present, but rather recalls a troubling time back in 2013-14. "It’s about the darkest time of my entire life, a time when I was getting really, really tossed up and going through a lot of personal stuff," he told Variety. "This is around 2013-14: I got arrested in Vegas, it was a real rockstar era, which I wasn’t really proud of, and at the end of [the song] you hear sirens. That’s me in the back of the cop car, that moment. "He continued: "I always wanted to make that song but I never did, and this album felt like the perfect time, because of the setting of Las Vegas, and [the character needing] a kind of escape after a heartbreak or whatever, \'I\'m gonna go to Vegas and drown all my sorrows,\' and by the time you get to the end of the album you realize it’s more of a redemption."' ,

		title: 'Papercut   --Linkin Park',
		image: 'images/papercut.jpg',
		details: 'The first verse explains that the person in question can feel that something isn\'t right but they don\'t know what it is and the metaphor for the thing that isn\'t right with is expressed as "the face inside". The "face inside" that Mike is talking about is the paranoia and the monsters inside your head. They could symbolise insecurities, depression, anxiety, whatever you can relate to. The lyric "right beneath my skin" means that "the face inside" is a part of you that criticises everything you and makes you paranoid of every mistake, every move you make, etc. The chorus is quite easy to understand, the whirlwind is the cacophony of thoughts that surges through one\'s mind when they are confused to a point that paranoia is all that they think of and they watch their every step and move, afraid of what "the face inside" will think - that is, what their critical side will think. When the sun goes down youre being left behind in the darkness thats already too much to bear, and you realize the darkness inside you now matches the darkness outside of you.',
